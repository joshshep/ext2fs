you must complete the course evaluation</h2>

<h1> Course Evaluation </h1>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EECS requires students evaluations of courses.

Students may access their online course evaluations in two ways:
A. Email invitations: These are sent to studentsâ€™ WSU email address (the preferred email address in myWSU).

B. myWSU: You log into myWSU and choose the Blue course evaluation dashboard in the center column. It will
        list the online course evaluations that are ready for courses you are enrolled in. Note that online course
        evaluations are released at different times, determined by each college. Please check your Blue dashboard in
        myWSU, as evaluations will appear as they are released by each college, with email notification as well.

     mv  /f1  /new/newfile      mv file to file
 
NOTE: Instead of INDIVIDUAL open-read-write, you may use YOUR cp to copy 
      small, large and huge files and verify that your cp works correctly.

     cp  f1 f2

    ----------------------      -------------------------------------------
    mount FS /a/b ; mount       mount FS to /a/b and show mounted devices
    cd /a/b       ; pwd         cd into mounted FS
    mkdir c; creat f            mkdir and create files on FS

    cd ../../../ ; pwd          cd backward to cross mounting point
    umount FS                   umount FS
    (test FS under Linux to verify its contents: c and f should exist)

    show other leverl-3 commands PER LEVEL-3 REQUIREMENTS IN WEBPAGE.
    cs; permission checking (rmdir/rm files not belonging to uid)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      TEST UNDER LINUX
1. After running YOUR project, mount the FD(file) under Linux; verify contents.

2. Run your project on the mydisk image with  X,    Y,      Z    directories
                                              |     |       |
                                             tiny bigfile hugefile
3. mkdir /X/newdiragain

4. cat and cp the tiny, big and huge files.
   then check results under Linux
