/ *************** DUE & DEMO : Week of 3-27-2017 ********************
 
 Write a C program, showblock, which displays the disk blocks of a file 
 in an EXT2 file system. The program runs as follows

       showblock  DEVICE    PATHNAME
       ---------  -------   ----------
e.g.   showblock  diskimage  /a/b/c/d  (diskimage contains an EXT2 FS)
OR     showblock  /dev/sda2  /x/y/z    (/dev/sda2 is YOUR HD partition)

 It locates the file named PATHNAME and prints the disk blocks (direct, 
 indirect, double-indirect) of the file.
**************************************************************************/ 

               HOWTO Traverse EXT2 File System Tree

1. REVIEW The Mailman's Algorithm

2. Traverse the EXT2 FS tree
   Given a device (mydisk or diskimage, containing an ext2 FS, and a pathname, 
   e.g. 
                   /cs360/is/fun
   of a file, find the file.

   NOTE!!! To find a file amounts to finding its INODE. 
           From the inode, you have ALL the information of a file.

  
3. ALGORITHM: Chapter 2; Section 2.8.2
  
1. Open the device for READ. 
   Read in Superblock (blk #1 for FD to verify it's indeed an ext2 FS. (HOW?)

   (With the SuperBlock read in, you might as well print some of its important
    fields, e.g. nblocks, ninodes, ngroups, inodes_per_group, number of free 
    inodes and blocks, etc.
   )

2. Read in the group descriptor block (block #2 for FD) and access Group0 
   Descriptor. From its bg_inode_table entry, determine where INODEs begin on 
   the disk. Call it the InodesBeginBlock.  

3. Read in InodeBeginBlock to get the inode of /, which is INODE #2.
   NOTE: inode number counts from 1.

4. Break up pathname into components and let the number of components be n,
   Example:
                            |<----- n = 3  ---->|
         /cs360/is/fun  ==> cs360     is      fun 

   Denote the components by name[0] name[1] name[n-1]

   YOU HAVE DONE THESE BEFORE!!!

6. Start from the root INODE in (3), search for name[0] in its data block(s).
   For DIRs, you may assume that (the number of entries is small so that) it 
   only has DIRECT data blocks. Therefore, search only the direct blocks for 
   name[0].

   Each data block of a DIR inode contains DIR structures of the form 

     [ino rlen nlen .   ] [ino rlen nlen ..  ] [ino rlen nlen NAME ] ....
     [ino rlen nlen NAME] [ino rlen nlen NAME] [ino rlen nlen NAME ] ....
     
   where each NAME is a string (without terminating NULL !!!) of nlen chars. 
   You may use nlen to extract the NAME string, and rlen to advance to the 
   next DIR structure (Listen to lecture in class). 

   If name[0] exists. you can find its inode number.

7. Use the inode number, ino, to locate the corresponding INODE:
   Recall that ino counts from 1.  Use the Mailman's algorithm

               (ino - 1) / 8    and   InodeBeginBlock    
               (ino - 1) % 8 
               
   to read in the INODE of /cs360

   NOTE: the number 8 comes from : for FD, blockSize=1024 and inodeSize=128. 
         If BlockSize != 1024, you must adjust the number 8 accordingly.

   From the INODE of /cs360, you can easily determine whether it's a DIR.
   
   (Remember S_ISDIR(), S_ISREG() ?)
  
   If it's not a DIR, there can't be anything like /cs360/is ...., so give up.

   If it's a DIR and there are more components yet to search (BAD NEWS!)
   you must go on.

   The problem now becomes:
       Search for name[1] in the INODE of /cs360
   which is exactly the same as that of Step (6).

8. Since Steps 6-7 will be repeated n times, you should implement a function
 
     int search(INODE * inodePtr, char * name)
         {
            // search for name string in the data blocks of this INODE
            // if found, return name's inumber
            // else      return 0
         }


7. Then, all you have to do is call search() n times, as sketched below.

   Assume:    n,  name[0], ...., name[n-1]   are globals

   ip --> INODE of /

   for (i= 0; i &lt; n; i++){
       inumber = search(ip, name[i])  
       if (inumber == 0) : can't find name[i], BOMB OUT!
       -------------------------------------------------------
       use inumber to read in its INODE and let ip --> this INODE 
   }
  
   // if you reach here, you must have ip --> the INODE of pathname.


8. Extract information from ip --> as required.
   Pat yourself on the back and say: Good Job!


9. SAMPLES SOLUTION in samples/SHOWBLOCK/:
            showblock.bin     diskimage
    Run it under Linux as
            showblock.bin diskimage pathname 
                                          
10. HELP sh scripts

(1). To create a mydisk with DIRs and FILEs:

    # mkdisk
    touch mydisk
    sudo mkfs mydisk 1440
    sudo mount -o loop mydisk /mnt
    (cd /mnt; mkdir a b c d; touch f1 f2 f3)
    ls -l /mnt
    sudo umount /mnt


(2). HOW TO CHECK EXT2 FS contents:

        #------ Run as a sh script -----------
        sudo mount -o loop diskimage  /mnt
        ls -l /mnt
        (cd into /mnt to browse its contents)
        sudo umount /mnt
        #------------------------------------


A diagram of INODES:


    |  InodeBeginBlock |                  |
---------------------------------------------------------
    |01|02|03|04|...|08|09|10|11|12|...|16|17....
---------|------------------------|----------------------
         |                        |
     -----------              ----------     
       INODE                    INODE
     i_block[0]               i_block[0]
     ----|------              ----|------
         |                        ----------------------
         |                        |. | ..|16 x |NN y |.....
         ----------------------   ----------------------
         | .| ..|12 a |13 b| ...  
         ----------------------

				 
(1). Given an INODE, search its data block(s) for a name, e.g. "a"
(2). Once you find "a", you find its inode number, ino,   e.g.  12
(3). Mailman's algorithm:
	 blk    = InodeBeginBlock + (ino-1)/8
	 offset = (ino-1)%8

(4). get_block(fd, blk, ibuf[]);         // get block containing this INODE
     INODE *ip = (INODE *)ibuf + offset; // ip points at INODE of /a in ibuf[ ]
