<h2>Introduction to Unix/Linux and MTX</H2>

<Pre>

1. You MUST have a computer running Linux which supports programming in C.
   Check YOUR Linux installation by trying to run some C programs.
 
   Example: Use a text editor, e.g. gedit, vi, nano, emacs, etc. 
            to create a source file test.c

         /******* test.c file *******/
         #include &lt;stdio.h>   
         #include &lt;stdlib.h>
         main()
         {
            int i;
            for (i=0; i < 10; i++)
                printf("i = %d\n", i);
         }
    
    -------------- Under Linux: --------------------
    gcc test.c         
    a.out
    ------------------------------------------------

2. About Ubuntu Linux:

Most of you probably installed Ubuntu Linux, e.g. Ubuntu 15.10, on your laptops.
Here are some helps regarding using the Ubuntu Linux.

2-1. When you get on your Ubuntu Linux, you are an ORDINARY user, not the SUPER
user. Many of the assignments of this class require you to have the SUPER user 
privilege.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1). As an ORDINARY user, you must use
           sudo COMMAND
(2). Your PATH environment variable setting typically does NOT include your 
     current directory (. or ./). To run an a.out image, you MUST enter
          ./a.out
     every time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        RECOMMENDED:

(3). go to your HOME directory in /home/YOURNAME
     Edit the .bashrc file by adding the line

     PATH=$PATH:./ 
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW your PATH includes the current directory ./ (so that you do not need ./a.out)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2-2. Some of you may have installed 64-bit Ubuntu Linux. That's fine. 
     BUT some assignments will work only on 32-bit machines.

     Use  gcc -m32 t.c    # to compile t.c into 32-bit code

If your 64-bit Linux can NOT take the -m32 option, you have to download support
for your (64-bit) gcc to generate 32-bit code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-3. Many of you are happy with pointing the mouse and click the nouse to do
     file copying. That's fine also.
BUT: it is NOT as powerful or convenient as using sh commands.

Try to learn from this class on how to use sh scripts, NOT mouse clicks, to
do file manipulations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Introduction to Systems Programming:

   <h4>Textbook: Chapter 2: Sections 2.1-2.2</h4>


4. The Unix File System Tree:
   The Unix file system is organized as a tree, as shown below.


            |--> bin 
            |--> dev
            |--> etc
     / ---> |--> lib
            |--> sbin
            |              |--> bin
            |--> tmp       |--> include --> .h files 
            |              |--> lib
            |--> usr ----->|--> local
            |              |--> man
            |--> user      |--> X11 ------>
            |--> vmunix 



   Each NODE of the tree is a FILE. Unix files have the following types:

5. Unix File Types:

   (1). Directory files : 
        These are directories. A directory may contain other directories 
        and (non-directory) files.

   (2). Non-directory files : 
        Non-directory files are either REGULAR or SPECIAL files (SEE BELOW).
        Note that Non-directory files can only appear as leaf-nodes in the 
        tree.

        (2).1  REGULAR files : 
               Regular files are also called ORDINARY files. They contain 
               either ordinary text or executable binary codes.

        (2).2  SPECIAL files : 
               Special files are entries in the /dev directory. They represent
               I/O devices, and are further classified as . 

               CHAR  special files, e.g. /dev/tty0, /dev/modem.
               BLOCK special files, e.g. /dev/fd0,  /dev/hda.
               Other types such as Network special files.

   (3). Soft LINK files:
        These are Regular files whose contents are pathnames of other 
        files. As such they are used to reference other files.
        Example: the Unix command
                 ln   -s   aVeryLongFileName   myLink
        sets up  myLink  as a soft-link to  aVeryLongFileName.  Access to 
        myLink will be re-directed to the actual file aVeryLongFileName.

6. Pathname:

   The ROOT node of a Unix file system tree, symbolized by /, is called the 
   "root directory".

   Each node of the tree is represented by a PATHNAME of the form

             /a/b/c/d    OR    a/b/c/d

   So, each Unix file is specified by a pathname.

*   A pathname is ABSOLUTE if it begins with a /.  
*   A pathname is RELATIVE if it does not begin with a /. 
 
    A relative pathname starts from the Current Working Directory (CWD).
    When a user login to Unix, the CWD is usually set to his/hers HOME 
    directory.  The CWD can be changed by using the cd  command.  
    The pwd command prints the absolute pathname of the CWD.
            
7. Contents of Directories Under / :  

   /bin : commonly used system commands, e.g ls, date,...
   /dev : Special files.
   /etc : Unix system maintenance files.
   /home: user home directories.

   /lib : Unix system libraries.
   /sbin: Unix system administration commands.
   /tmp : temporary files.
   /usr : /usr/bin:      more executable files such as  cc,  gzip.
          /usr/include : .h files
          /usr/lib:      specific library files.
          /usr/man     : on-line manual directory.
          /usr/X11     : X-Window system.

8. <h4>Login: (Chapter 2.11: From login to command execution)</h4>

<h2>Unix/Linux Commands</h2>
ls  [filename];  ls -l [filename]
cd  [DIRname]
pwd
touch filename
cat [filename]
cp  file1  file2
mv  file1  file2

mkdir dirname
rmdir dirname
rm    filename
link  oldfile  newfile
unlink filename
symlink oldfile  newfile


9. REVIEW QUESTIONS:

(1). The   ls -l   command lists the contents of a directory:

drwxr-xr-x   root   bin     2048  Dec 23 09:22 bin/
lrwxrwxrwx   root   root      23  Dec 20 20:15 kwang -> /home/kwang/public_html
-rw-r--r--   root   root  433387  Dec  8 21:52 vmlinuz
-rwxr-xr-x   kwang  kwang  21400  Jan  8 07:30 a.out

EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF EACH field?

(2). What are the permission bits of a file, and what do they do?
     
(3). Each user has a UserId (uid) and a GroupId (gid).  
     How does a user get hid/her uid and gid?
     What are the uid and gid used for? 

(4). The owner of a file can use the Unix command
         chmod  0766  fileName  
     to change the mode of fileName. What are the resulting permissions?

(5). What does the x bits of a directory mean?

(6). Unix has a special user, called the SuperUser or the Root, who can access
     any file. What's the reason for having such a Super user?

(7). How does a user acquire a Unix process?

(8). How many processes will be executing with the sh command?
         %  a & b & c & d &
     Which one is the foreground process?

(9). The Unix command    ls | more
     sets up 2 processes, one executes ls and the other executes more, in such 
     a way that the outputs of the first process ls are PIPEd to the second 
     process more. 
     How many processes will be executing with the sh command?
         %  a | b | c | d
