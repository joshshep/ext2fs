1. IP stands for Internet Protocol. 
   TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a protocol built on top of IP. 
   TCP/IP is the backbone of InterNet. Currently there are 2 versions of IP, 
   known as IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses 32-bit address and IPv6 uses 128-bit 
   address. The discussion here is based on IPv4, which is still the predominat
   version IP in use.

2. Host and IP address:
   A host is a machine that runs IP. Every host is identified by a unique 32-bit
   number called the IP address. For human convenience, this 32-bit number is 
   usually expressed in a "dotted" notation, such as 134.121.64.1  
   A host is also known by a host name, e.g. dns1.eecs.wsu.edu. 
   Host name and IP address are "equivalent" in that, given one, we can find the
   other (by host dnsNAME or host IPaddress).

3. What is IP ?  
   IP is a protocol for sending/receiving data packets between hosts. 
   IP operates in a best-effort manner, i.e. it just sends the packets out, but
   it does NOT guarantee that they will be delivered to their destinations, NOR
   in order. So, IP may be unreliable.  

4. IP Packet Format:
   An IP packet consists of

      | Header |SrcIP|DestIP|<-----  DATA ----->|
         12        4    4   |
      |<--------------------- upto 64K bytes -->|
  
   The Header part contains more information, e.g. total length, TCP/UDP, TTL, 
   check-sum for error detection, etc. about the packet so that a receiving
   host would know what to do with the packet. For example, an IP packet is
   simply dropped if its check-sum indicates an error or its TTL has expired.

5. Routers:
   IP hosts may be located far apart. It is usually not possible to send data 
   packets from one host to the other DIRECTLY. 
   "Routers" are special IP hosts that receive and forward packets. Therefore, 
   IP packets may go through many routers, or "hops", before arriving at a
   destination. 


6. UDP (User DataGram Protocol)
   UDP operates on top of IP. It is used to send/receive "datagrams". Like IP,
   UDP does NOT guarantee reliability but it is fast and efficient. It is used 
   in situations where reliablility is not essential.
   Example:

      ping mail.wsu.edu     OR    ping 134.121.137.14
   
   ping is a program that sends a UDP packet to a host, which "echo" the UDP 
   packet back to the sender with a round-trip time in msec.
      
7. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   TCP also operates on top of IP but guarantees reliable data transfer. It is
   a connection-oriented protocol for sending/receiving "data streams". 

   A common analogy is that UDP is similar to "telegram" (or USPS)
                            TCP is similar to "telephone".

8. Port Number:
   At each IP host, many applications may be running UDP/TCP at the same time. 
   Each application is uniquely identified by a triple
        Application = (HostIP, Protocol, PortNumber)
   where Protocol is either UDP or TCP, and PortNumber is a unique 2-byte 
   unsiged integer assigned to the application. In order to use UDP or TCP at 
   a host, an application (process) must choose or obtain a PortNumber first. 
   The first 1024 port numbers (0 to 1023) are reserved.  

9. Network and Host (byte) Order:
   Machines may use either "big-endian" or "little-endian" byte-ordering. 
   On the "Internet", data are always in "network order", which is "big-endian".

   A set of library functions htons()/htonl(), ntohs()/ntohl() are used to 
   convert data between host-order and network-order. 

10. Server-Client Model:
    In network programming, we typically run a Server at a host first. 
    The Server waits for Client requests and serves the requests. 
    In UDP, the Server simply waits for "datagrams" from a Client. 
    In TCP, the Server waits for a Client to "connect".

    Then, we run the Client from a client host, 
    In UDP, the client sends each request as a UDP datagram to the Server. 
            Then it tries to receive a reply datagram from the Server.
 
    In TCP, the Client requests to connect to the Server first. 
    Then the Server and Client can exchange "continuous streams" of data.

In the following, we shall show how to do network programming using TCP.

11. Network Programming:
    Unix (Linux) Kernel provides TCP/IP support. User interface to TCP/IP is
    through "sockets". To the user (program), creating a socket is similar to 
    opening a file for RW. It returns an integer socket number, which can be 
    used as a file descriptor in read()/write() system calls.

12. Sockets Programming

    First, we need the following C structs defined in netdb.h and sys/socket.h

12-1.The socket address data structure:

    struct sockaddr_in {
       u_short        sin_family; /* protocol identifier; usually AF_INET */
       u_short        sin_port;   /* port number. 0 means let kernel choose */
       struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* IP address. INADDR_ANY=the current host.*/
       char           sin_zero[8];}; /* Unused, always zero */
    }

    struct in_addr {
        u_long s_addr;
    };

12-2. The hostent struct in &lt;netdb.h&gt; is as shown (man gethostbyname):
        
        struct hostent {
               char    *h_name;        // DOT name string of host
               char    **h_aliases;    // alias list 
               int     h_addrtype;     // host address type
               int     h_length;       // length of address
               char    **h_addr_list;  // list of addresses (long IP address)
        }
        #define h_addr  h_addr_list[0]  // for backward compatibility 

        // NOTE: h_addr is defined as a char * but it points at the IP_address,
        //       which is a 4-byte number in network (big-endian) order.
        // ulong NIP = *(ulong *)h_addr is the IP_address in network order.
        // ulong HIP = ntohl(NIP) is NIP in host order (INTEL=little-endian).
        // inet_ntoa(NIP) converts NIP to a string in DOT notation.

13. An ECHO Server/Client Program using TCP

    Download server.c and client.c files from our ~samples/LAB5/ directory.

    First, run the server at a host as        server [hostname]
    where hostname is either the DNS name or IP address of the host machine. 
    If no hostname is given, the default "localhost" (127.0.0.1) will be used.

    The Server first displays the server's hostname, IP address and port number
    Then it waits for a client to connect.

    Next, run the client at another host as   client ServerName ServerPort

    (You may also run both on the SAME host but in separate X-windows).

    After connecting to the server, the client asks the user for an input 
    string, sends it to the server, which simply echos the string back.

    When the client ends (by Enter key or Control-C), the server detects that 
    the client has broken off the TCP connection and loops back to accept 
    another connection, etc.

    The sequence of actions between the server and the client are shown
    in the following diagram.

                                ACTIONS OF 
            Server                                       Client:
   --------------------------------      ---------------------------------
1. Display hostname, IP, Port#      ===> 1. MUST know Server's name|IP,Port#
2. Construct a server_addr struct        2. Construct a server_addr struct 
3. Create a TCP socket with Port#        3. Create a TCP socket sock
4. Bind socket to server_addr info             
5. Listen at socket by listen() syscall
6. newsock = accept()               <==  4. connect() to Server via sock
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Send/Receive Data
7. READ from newsock      <------------------  WRITE to  sock
   WRITE to  newsock      ------------------>  READ from sock
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. loop to 6 to accept next client             close(sock);



The above Server/Client code may be used as the basis for TCP-orineted network
programming. You may adapt it for different applications by simply changing the
data contents and the ways they process the data.

========================== HOMEWORK =======================================
Modify the server.c and client.c files to do computations:
       client: send 2 numbers to server, which returns the SUM.
